    This operates by iterating over the members of the class and calling this function again when another `hk` instance
    is found as a member value, passing in the `hk` type detected in that member's information in `dest_object_type`.
    Non-`hk` members (primitive Python types or arrays) are copied directly.

    If a member name in `source_object` is not found in `dest_object_type`, an error will be raised and the converter
    will attempt to handle it automatically: the source object's class, the name and value of the member, and the
    in-progress instance of `dest_object_type` will all be passed to `source_error_handler`. This handler should
    attempt to update the appropriate new members in the dest object, and return a list of new member names affected.
    If it returns `None`, that will indicate that the handler could not resolve the problem, and the error will
    be raised to the caller (which may be a higher call of this same function, and will attempt to handle the error the
    same way).

    If any member names in `dest_object_type` are not found in `source_object`, and are not in one of the lists
    returned by a `dest_error_handler` call, then an error will be immediately raised (as every member MUST be set to
    something in Python).

    Typically, you will call this on the `hkRootLevelContainer` at the top of the HKX file.

    TODO: `NotSerializable` members should be defaultable (0, None, or empty, I imagine).
